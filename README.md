# FLASK-Tutorial-from-Scratch
## What is FLASK?
Flask is a web framework for building websites and web applications using Python. It helps developers create web pages and handle user interactions easily. Think of it like a toolbox that provides tools and shortcuts for building websites without having to write everything from scratch. 
In simple terms, Flask, a web framework, relies on three main parts to work properly:<br><br>

**Routing:** It decides what code to run for different URLs.<br><br>
**Debugging:** It helps find and fix errors in code.<br><br>
**WSGI subsystem:** It handles communication between web servers and Python web applications.<br><br>
**Jinja2:** This is used for templates in Flask. Templates help to create HTML pages dynamically by combining static HTML with data from the application.<br><br>
**Click:** Click helps Flask integrate with the command line. It allows developers to create custom commands that can be run from the terminal to perform tasks related to their Flask application.<br><br>
