## What is FLASK?
Flask is a web framework for building websites and web applications using Python. It helps developers create web pages and handle user interactions easily.

The basic flow of a web application using Flask:
1. **Client-Server Interaction**: The request from the client side (e.g., a web browser) is sent to the server side (e.g., where your Flask application is running).
2. **Python with Flask**: On the server side, the code is written in Python using the Flask framework. Flask is indeed a popular framework for building web applications in Python due to its simplicity and flexibility.
3. **Response Generation**: The Flask code processes the request and generates a response, which typically includes HTML content to be rendered in the client's browser.
4. **Sending Response to Client**: The response is then sent back to the client side, where it is rendered by the client's web browser.
5. **Purpose of Flask**: Flask is used to write code that handles incoming requests on the server side, processes data, interacts with databases, and generates appropriate responses to be sent back to the client. It provides tools and utilities to make building web applications easier and more efficient.

In simple terms, Flask, a web framework, relies on the following parts to work properly:<br><br>

**Routing:** It decides what code to run for different URLs.<br><br>
**Debugging:** It helps find and fix errors in code.<br><br>
**WSGI subsystem:** WSGI is crucial for server-side communication, it does not have a direct role in client-side processes. Its primary purpose is to enable seamless interaction between web servers and Python web applications on the server side.<br><br>
**Jinja2:** Jinja2 is like a tool that helps Flask to create web pages by combining HTML with dynamic content.<br><br>
